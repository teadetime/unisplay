# Unisplay
An Open-Source, ergonomic, Unibody Split keyboard

### Origin Story
I made the mistake of building 7 keyboards at once -- ordering all the parts from JLCPCB. I learned a lot in the process, and even considered making my own PCB. Unfortunately, none of my keyboards felt like a perfect fit. I liked the thumbs, splay and pinky stagger of my [owl](https://github.com/sapristi/owl) but loved the single piece design of my [reviung](https://github.com/gtips/reviung).

I wanted something in between these two and bluetooth. I had just had good succes building a wireless Draculad using Seeed Xiao nrf boards (cheaper than nice!nano's). Unfortunately the closest things I could find were, the [Osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette), [Zaphod lite](https://kbd.news/Zaphod-Lite-1507.html), [Bad Wings](https://shop.hazel.cc/products/bad-wings?variant=39814780682289), and [Splaytoraid](https://github.com/freya-irl/splaytoraid40).

I took what I felt was the best parts of all of these boards and tried to put it into one.

My goals and requirements:
- Bluetooth w/Seee Xiao
- Lowest cost
- Unibody Split
- Aggressive pinky stagger
- Encoder
- 36 keys
- Case can be made with materials on hand (Epilog laser cutter, 3d printers)

### Introducing Unisplay:

**[Case files available here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4fc5c2af25eeae18645efbd3/w/9f913b638a91c140dea12e5a/e/957759159765f5f250ad211d)**

### Design process:
I did all fo the case design in Onshape, it is publically available. One limiting factor of the design is that the keyboard is quite wide and would be hard to fit onto a consumer print bed. I apologize for this and tried to avoid this but I simply could not. Please feel free to make a copy of the files and edit as you wish. There isn't a super easy way to make this printable in small pieces. I wouldn't bother unless you have access to a laser cutter.
